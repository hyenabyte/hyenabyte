My name is David

I do mainly full stack web development, with a focus on everything TypeScript, but I love exploring new technologies.
I'm currently learning Rust and Nix, and dabbling in Gleam.

I daily drive NixOS on my desktop pc, as well as my homelab and I am currently looking to switch out my Macbook for a laptop that I also can put NixOS on. Have a look at my [NixOS configs](https://github.com/hyenabyte/nixos-config) if that is something that interests you ðŸ˜Š

I love open source, and a goal of mine is to contribute more or maintain an open source project.

A few projects I am working on:
 - Patchworks: a twitch bot to help streamers, written in TypeScript using NestJS (but I am considering rewriting in rust)
 - Muteoki (working title): a colorscheme inspired by [Flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki), [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) and [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
 - My personal website: [hyenabyte.dev](https://hyenabyte.dev) ([source](https://github.com/hyenabyte/hyenabyte-astro)), made with Astro. V1.0 is ready, but there is still a lot I want to do with it

Here is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I have worked with: 

 `html` `css` `sass/scss` `php` `composer` `wordpress` `symfony` `js` `ts` `node.js` `deno` `npm` `pnpm` `bun` `webpack` `vite` `react` `nextjs` `vue` `nuxt` `svelte` `solidjs` `astro` `medusajs` `nestjs` `strapi` `directus` `supabase` `SQL` `MySQL` `MariaDB` `PostgreSQL` `Prisma` `Drizzle` `docker` `kubernetes` `linux` `rust` `gleam` `nix` `c#` `haxe` `lua` `unity` `godot` `bevy` `blender` `inkscape`
